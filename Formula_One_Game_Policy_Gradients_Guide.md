# Integrating Policy Gradients into Formula One Game with PyTorch

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to integrate a policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm into a Formula One style game using PyTorch.

## 1. Policy Network

First, define the neural network that will represent the policy:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=0)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(state))
        action_probs = self.softmax(self.layer2(x))
        return action_probs

input_size = # Define the size of your state vector
hidden_size = 128
output_size = 3 # 3 actions: left, right, stay

policy_net = PolicyNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy_net.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

## 2. State Representation

Define a function to convert the game state to a PyTorch tensor:

```python
def get_state_tensor(state):
    # Convert the state to a tensor
    # Example: state = np.array([player_pos, obstacle_pos, ...])
    return torch.from_numpy(state).float()
```

## 3. Action Function

Define how actions affect the game:

```python
def perform_action(game, action):
    # Modify the game state and compute the reward
    # Return the new state, reward, and game over status
    pass # Implement this function
```

## 4. Game Loop for AI Control

Integrate the AI into the game loop:

```python
def game_loop(policy_net):
    state = get_initial_state(game) # Initialize the game state
    done = False

    while not done:
        state_tensor = get_state_tensor(state)
        action_probs = policy_net(state_tensor)
        action = torch.multinomial(action_probs, 1).item()
        next_state, reward, done = perform_action(game, action)
        state = next_state
        if done:
            break
```

## 5. Training Loop with Policy Gradients

Implement the training loop using policy gradients:

```python
def collect_trajectory(game, policy_net):
    states, actions, rewards = [], [], []
    state = get_initial_state(game)
    done = False

    while not done:
        state_tensor = get_state_tensor(state)
        action_probs = policy_net(state_tensor)
        action = torch.multinomial(action_probs, 1).item()
        next_state, reward, done = perform_action(game, action)
        states.append(state_tensor)
        actions.append(action)
        rewards.append(reward)
        state = next_state

    return states, actions, rewards

def calculate_returns(rewards, gamma=0.99):
    R = 0
    returns = []
    for r in rewards[::-1]:
        R = r + gamma * R
        returns.insert(0, R)
    return returns

def update_policy(policy_net, optimizer, trajectories):
    policy_gradient = []
    for states, actions, returns in trajectories:
        for state, action, R in zip(states, actions, returns):
            action_probs = policy_net(state)
            action_prob = action_probs[action]
            policy_gradient.append(-torch.log(action_prob) * R)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    policy_loss = torch.stack(policy_gradient).sum()
    policy_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

def train_policy_gradient(game, policy_net, optimizer, num_episodes):
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        trajectories = [collect_trajectory(game, policy_net) for _ in range(num_trajectories)]
        returns = [calculate_returns(rewards) for _, _, rewards in trajectories]
        update_policy(policy_net, optimizer, zip(states, actions, returns))
```

## Complete Integration

To integrate this into your game, ensure that the `get_initial_state`, `get_state_tensor`, and `perform_action` functions are correctly implemented according to your game's mechanics.

### Notes

- Remember to tune hyperparameters like learning rate and gamma.
- Normalize returns for stability.
- The training might take a significant amount of time.

This implementation provides a basic framework. Depending on the complexity of your game, you might need to explore more sophisticated methods.
